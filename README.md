## ⌨️ Your shortcuts

| Shortcut         | Action                                                    |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| ⌥⌘V              | Open the picker                                           |
| ⌃N / ⌃P or ↓ / ↑ | Move through picker results                               |
| Return           | Paste the selected clip                                   |
| ⇧Return          | Paste the selected clip as plain text, when available     |
| ⇧⌘V              | Paste the current clipboard as plain text, when available |
| ⇧⌘Space          | Open History Manager from the picker                      |
| Esc              | Dismiss the picker                                        |

Type in the picker to search. If macOS input-source shortcuts intercept ⇧⌘Space, use **Open History Manager…** from the menu bar.

## 📦 Download

Download [The Clipboard v0.4.1](https://github.com/iomz/TheClipboard/releases/download/v0.4.1/TheClipboard-0.4.1-arm64.dmg), or browse [Releases](https://github.com/iomz/TheClipboard/releases).

🪴 A fresh application identity with its own clips, favorites and settings. No data or preferences are imported from another app. Allow Accessibility for **The Clipboard** when prompted to paste into other apps.

⚠️ Builds are **development-signed, not Developer ID signed or Apple-notarized**. Gatekeeper may block launch. If blocked, stop rather than bypassing macOS security.

## 🦋 Updating
